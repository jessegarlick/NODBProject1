# React + Vite



These are my favorite candies.  I listed them from my initial data with set prices and 1 qty.  Essentially when you click any edit button you can edit the name, price or qty.  the amount is price* qty.  you can also delete a row or add a row.  

things that I am looking to learn for the future.  I would like to know how to set up an addcart function where you could add each candy and then the cart would list the items and add them up.  I also wish to learn about how to style this more with css.  Using css with react is a little tricky I have noticed.  I messed around with it and soon realized that I shouldnt mess with anything.
